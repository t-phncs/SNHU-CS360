### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
> The purpose of this app is to make user inventory manageble by the tracking implementation 
### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
> We have a login screen, a sign up screen and a main database screen so user can access and utilize the tracking function
### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
> The process is simple at first, but will be getting more complicated towards the end, escpecially, the databse side of the app, since you will be spending more time to debug instead of coding
### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
> I think to ensure the code is functional, we need to design the wireframe(layout) first, then run the code to check whether the layout is breaking in Android Studio or not. After finishing that phase, we can move on to develop and test.  
### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
> From the initial planning, we need to understand the assginment first, then progress slowly and carefully toward the ends of the project. 
### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
> I was able to make main screen to communicate with different screen by a click of a button.
